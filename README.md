# Multimodal_crypto_prediction
This Repo records the code of multimodal Bitcoin prediction with deep learning methods and related research literature.

## Abstract:
This research investigates the influence of multimodality on diverse deep learning architectures in the context of short-term cryptocurrency forecasting. We introduce CryptoBERT, an advanced sentiment analysis model tailored for cryptocurrency, and apply it to analyze an extensive dataset comprising 700,000+ social media posts and crypto news articles. Our exploration involves LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and transformer models. Noteworthy outcomes indicate the LSTM model achieves the highest accuracy (MAPE = 0.0377), showing a notable 5 percent improvement with multimodal inputs. The transformer, while not yielding superior predictions, demonstrates a 20 percent enhancement with multimodality. We meticulously interpret these findings and provide detailed insights into their underlying reasons. Additionally, we outline future efforts to refine our models and further enhance our predictive framework.
